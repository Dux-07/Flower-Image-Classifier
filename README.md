# Flower-Image-Classifier

The world of artificial intelligence has opened up numerous possibilities in various fields. One such field that has benefited from the advancements in AI is image classification. The ability to accurately classify images has numerous applications, including in the field of botany.

In this project, we aim to build a flower image classifier using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. We will utilize the VGG-16 CNN architecture as a pre-trained model, which has shown promising results in various image classification tasks.

The dataset used for this project will be the "102 category flower set", consisting of over 8000 flower images, with each image labeled according to its species. The model will be trained on this dataset using deep learning techniques to accurately classify different species of flowers.

The accuracy of the model will be evaluated using various performance metrics, and we will fine-tune the model based on the results obtained. The ultimate goal of this project is to build a robust and accurate flower image classifier that can be utilized in real-world applications.
